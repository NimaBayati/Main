## LiDAR & Thermal Sensor Fusion

Course: ECS 193A/B - Senior Design Project

  - In a group of 4, we developed a solution based on our clientâ€™s criteria
  - We mapped thermal camera images to a 3D point cloud to convey the temperature of objects in a scene through color
  - The client's github repo is private, so I'll present an informational graphic below that explains my group's work
