## Implementation of a Single-Cycle, In-order CPU with the RISC-V ISA

#### Project Specifications:
  - The basic design of the CPU and the implementation of the ALU and Memory was given.
  - My task was to complete the CPU by implementing: the control units for the ALU and CPU, the nextPC unit to handle jumps/branches, and then
the connections on the CPU itself to tie everything together.

#### Languages Utilized:
